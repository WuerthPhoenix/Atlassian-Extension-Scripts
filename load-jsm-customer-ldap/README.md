```
     "tmpdirldpap" : "/tmp/ad.csv",  <- Temporary folder for ldpap csv
     "ldaphost"    : "<LDAP SERVER IP/FQDN>" ,
     "ldapbase"    : "cn=admin,dc=example,dc=com", 
     "ldapbind"    : "<LDAP USER/Bindname>",
     "ldappwd"     : "/opt/jira/.pwd_jira_ldap", <- password is the only alphanumeric string that should be in the file and of course you can change the path!

     "ldapfields"  : " department mail givenName sn sAMAccountName" <- List of LDAP Attributes to be extracted. Changing this list requires changes in the script!!

    { "department" : "department 1"  },
