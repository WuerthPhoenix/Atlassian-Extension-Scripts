### jira.conf
- Script Configuration. This file needs to be filled with LDAP environment information
- By default jira.conf looks for Bind password in path /opt/jira/.pwd_jira_ldap <br>
   (password is the only alphanumeric string that should be in the file and of course you can change the path!)
- in activedirectorydepartments you can specify all or specific entity. For example in case of "departments" you can specify them as
```
 "activedirectorydepartments" : [
    { "department" : "department 1"  }, 
    { "department" : "department 2"  } 
  ]
```
or for all

```
 "activedirectorydepartments" : [
    { "department" : "*"  } 
  ]
```
